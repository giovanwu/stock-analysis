# 2017-2018 Selected Stocks Analysis 
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor the original VBA script from Module 2 solution to loop through all the stock data one time and compare if the run time for the refactored VBA script is faster than the original VBA script.

## Results
### 1.
When we compare the performances of the stock data that is provided, we can see that 9 out of 12 stocks that had a positive return in 2017 received a negative return in 2018, 1 out of 12 stocks remained a negative return in both 2017 and 2018, and 2 out of 12 stocks had positive returns in 2017 and 2018, which are ENPH and RUN.

Additionally, when we compare the execution times of the original script and the refactored script, we found out that the refactored script did become more efficient as it takes significantly less time to run the analysis than the original script.

## Summary
### Advantages of Refactored VBA Script:
-You can spend less time to run analysis and make it more efficient
-It will be easier to adjust data from the refactored script than the original script, especially if you want to ruin a significantly larger dataset.
### Disadvantages of Refactored VBA Script:
-If you don’t properly format the positioning of the codes, it is easy for people to mess up the script or get lost and can’t figure out what went wrong
### Advantages of Original VBA Script:
-easier to compose the code especially when there is less data to run with
### Disadvantages of Original VBA Script:
-can get very frustrating to adjust the script when you have to deal with a larger dataset 

## Ultimately, the refactored code will be the most recommended script to run the stock data since it is more efficient and easy to adjust data.
